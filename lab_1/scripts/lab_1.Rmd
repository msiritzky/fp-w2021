```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
```

3. Use the “airquality” dataset, which is part of base R. Split it by `Month`

```{r}
by_month <- split(airquality, airquality$Month)

str(by_month)
```

4. Use a for loop to calculate the mean Ozone by month (remember to remove missing data from the calculation)

```{r}
mean_ozone <- rep(NA, length(by_month))

for (i in seq_along(by_month)) {
  mean_ozone[i] <- mean(by_month[[i]]$Ozone, na.rm = TRUE)
}

mean_ozone
```
